Aurangabad Tourism
This is a Basic website containing a Home page about Aurangabad Tourism. Here I have use HTML and CSS. This Website also contains a Sign-up Page and a contact form.
Motivation behind this was to nothing but I wanted to try and implement what I have learned in HTML and CSS.  Also, I wanted to learn how a website is hosted using GitHub.
I took the Reference from W3school for my website
